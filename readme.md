### ED stem Atom

ed stem was the only thing that my uni course used that didn't 
have an RSS/Atom feed so I created this so I could easily keep
all my notifications in one place

to run it you must
 - Create a file called "details"
 - Put your username and password in that file seperated by a space

then run `nimble run`

p.s. please hire me ed stem ðŸ˜›
