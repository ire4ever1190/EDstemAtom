### ED stem Atom

ed stem was the only thing that my uni course used that didn't 
have an RSS/Atom feed so I created this so I could easily keep
all my notifications in one place

to run it you must
 - create a file called "token" containing your "x-token" header

then run `nimble run`

p.s. please hire me ed stem ðŸ˜›
